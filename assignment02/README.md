### Susana Flores

- Website Used: URL: [Nairobi](http://lkoblenc.digitalscholar.rochester.edu/assignment02/index.html)

- Fonts currently in use: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif

### Changes to Webpage Structure
- Centered elements that were slightly off-center so that the content of the page looked more organized.
- Added padding and margins to elements to put more space between them and make it easier for the user to understand where the sections lie.
- Reorganized the structure of the about page to make it more clean and less condensed. 
	- Changed about page from display: flex, as the paragraphs were short in width and very long. Instead aligned them and the corresponding images in a Z format so the users eye is more naturally drawn through the page. 
- Added borders around the headers and paragraphs to specify where the sections were and divide the content to make the page look more clean.
- Changed the background color of both pages so they were the same color, a dark grey as it seemed the mood of the webpage was originally dark and minimal using the colors of the Kenya seal. 

### Fonts
- As it stands, the page has black text in the home page, yellow in the about. Bacause of the dark background that will be changed to white on all pages for some consistency. Some text has colored shadow which will be removed as it makes it hard to read.
- Two new fonts were used, Merriweather, serif for the headers and Trebuchet MS, sans-serif for the navigation and paragraph text. 
	- Trebuchet MS was used for the more abundant sections of text because it is more legible and clean so it increases readability more so than the last font used since it is more bold so it is easier to read against the background. 
	- Merriweather was used for the main header because it is larger and more dramatic, it draws attention to itself because it is different than the other elements of the page which is useful to emphasize the fact that the page's content is over what the header indicates. The font is also more mature yet maintains that minimal look which makes it more distinctive and further emphasizes the importance of the content which it contains.
- Increased line height in the paragraphs so the text wouldn't look so condensed and the user had an easier time reading through the lines of text.
- Increased line spacing in the navigation to break up the words and make them legible.
- Increased font size in the header to draw attention there, added the header in the about page to create a sense of consistency between pages. 
- Changed background color in the headers. Originally it seemed the designer attempted to draw from the colors of the Kenya seal and did so with the text on the page. This decreased readability as the contrast wasn't great and the stark difference between the dark background and yellow letters was uncomfortable to read. Instead these colors were used in the background colors of the headers and navigation bar as well as the border around them. 
- The background color of the paragraphs was made slightly lighter than the background so there wouldnt be a dramatic contrast between the black of the background and the white letters, a softer background increased readilbility by making the text easier to scan.
