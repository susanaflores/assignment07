### Susana Flores

- Website Used: URL: [Nairobi](http://lkoblenc.digitalscholar.rochester.edu/assignment02/index.html)

- Fonts currently in use: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Changes Made
- Centered elements that were slightly off-center.
- Added padding and margins to elements to put more space between them.
- Chnaged about page from display: flex as the paragraphs were short in width and very long. Instead aligned them in a Z format so the users eye is more naturally drawn through the page. 
- Changed the background color of both pages so they were the same color, a dark grey as it seemed the mood of the webpage was originally dark and minimal using the colors of the Nairobi seal.
